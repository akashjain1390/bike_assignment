## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
This project focuses on developing a predictive model for BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing company, to estimate the demand for shared bikes. After experiencing revenue declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic, BoomBikes seeks insights into the factors affecting bike demand to create a strategic business plan for post-pandemic recovery.

- What is the background of your project?
Bike-sharing has become increasingly popular in urban areas as people choose more eco-friendly, convenient travel options. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant reduction in usage, as lockdowns and social distancing measures reduced the need for shared transportation. BoomBikes, along with other companies in the shared mobility industry, now faces the challenge of understanding and adapting to these changes to remain competitive. By analyzing demand trends, BoomBikes aims to optimize its service offerings to better meet customer needs and prepare for future demand as the market stabilizes.

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?

BoomBikes wants to address the following business issues:

Identify Key Demand Drivers: Discover the variables that significantly impact daily bike demand, such as weather conditions, seasonal trends, and temporal factors.

Accurately Predict Demand: 
Develop a model to forecast bike demand based on these influential factors, which will allow BoomBikes to improve resource allocation, set pricing strategies, and optimize operational processes.

Inform Strategic Planning:
Use data insights to design a business strategy that maximizes demand and profitability, helping BoomBikes to stand out in the competitive bike-sharing market and meet evolving customer expectations.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
The dataset that has been used for this is day.csv.

## Conclusions
- Train dataset R^2          : 0.835
- Test dataset R^2           : 0.8113
- Train dataset Adjusted R^2 : 0.829    
- Test dataset Adjusted R^2  : 0.832
Demand of bikes depend on year, holiday, atemp, windspeed, sep, Light_snowrain, Mist, spring, summer and winter.
